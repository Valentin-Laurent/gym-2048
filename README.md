# Introduction

Open AI gym environment for the game 2048, that I use in [this reinforcement learning project](https://github.com/Valentin-Laurent/Year-2048).

Forked from [this repository](https://github.com/rgal/gym-2048). The main reasons for the fork are:
 - Allowing illegal moves (ie: not ending episode when an illegal move occurs)
 - Fixing graphical game rendering
 - Starting a game with a large tile (ex: 512)
